# Simple-LDA-and-QDA
LDA and QDA are implemented in Python, including multi-dimension and multi-label. Other extended versions that are covered are Diagonal Discriminant Analysis, Regularized Discriminant Analysis and Reduced Rank Discriminant Analyisi.

The "sample_dataset.py" generates the dataset with the required sample size, feature dimension and number per group.
The "estimate.py" provides three ways to estimate the parameters, including diagonal, regularzied and normal method.
The "classification.py" is used to classify the dataset by using different methods, such as QDA/LDA, Diagonal and Reduced-Rank.
The "scatter_contour.py" draw a 2-d dimension scatter plot and the decision boundary, method used by it depends on the DA method.
